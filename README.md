Small project that scrapes flags from wikipedia page, converts the vector files to raster, converts the colors from RGB to Lab\* color space and then averages the colors (mathematical operations in Lab\* color space result in more intuitive results, based on our perception of color).

README is in construction, plenty of comments were included in the R script to make it understandable.

``` r
include_graphics("rotation_globe.gif")
```
